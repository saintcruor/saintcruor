⠀⠀We will just avoid/block you if you make us uncomfortable! Just know we are pro m-spec lesbian/gay, anti-radqueer, pro-non traumagenic systems, and we're anti leaning on shipcourse.


⠀⠀We personally avoid fans of hazbin hotel/helluva boss, dandy's world, eddsworld, mouthwashing, supernatural, mandela catalogue, the magnus archives, and SMPs, but we wouldn't entirely stop you.

⠀⠀We're personally uncomfortable with anyone over 18 interacting.

<p align="right"> 
We're plural consiousflux. We collectively go by chimera/sentry, he/ask. Do not ask one of us to front, but we're ok ⠀⠀with you asking who is fronting.⠀⠀

We're shy btw. We will interact super dry at first, since we have horrible social anxiety.

We're not a fan of a bunch of ships, just don't mention any in front of us. There is a good chance we'll avoid you if you like something /we/ don't like.

Sexual comments bother us if you're not a close friend, please avoid them. We don't like the "im gonna touch you" jokes either.

We walk away or go silent if you make us uncomfortable usually. We're not expecting an apology, we just prefer you not to talk to us afterwards.</p>
