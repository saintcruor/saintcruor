<a href="https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/" title="Link to carrd listing basic dni criteria">the basics</a>, xenosatanist, radqueer, proship/comship/darkship*, anti-non traumagenic systems, pro-contact / complex contact paraphilia, zionists/stand with israel, over 19 (18 is thin ice), queer exclusionists (anti-lesboy, anti-gaybian)

We personally avoid fans of hazbin hotel/helluva boss, dandy's world, eddsworld, mouthwashing, supernatural, mandela catalogue, the magnus archives, and SMPs, but we wouldn't entirely stop you.

*not into shipcourse, but those communities are problematic in themself. Keep your fantasies to yourself creeps.

<p align="right"> <b> <em> before you interact </em> </b> </p> 

<p align="right"> We are a praesigenic <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Parasian" title="definition">parasian</a> plurallet , we switch in-between "i/me" and "we/us". Do NOT use they/them if referring to us collectively, use he/him or refer to us as chimera. We do not mind if you ask who is fronting. We exclusively give our simplyplural to people we trust, but we keep our pluralkit public nonetheless but neither are updated frequently, rather a headcount and information archival.

We are very, <em> very </em> shy. We usually won't interact first unless we're feeling brave enough to crown someone or say hi. if we share an interest and we interact, we're most likely asking to be friends/mutuals.

Host selfships and would prefer if you /don't/ make romantic or carnal jokes about characters. Don't flirt with any of us either.

I'm not a fan of a bunch of ships. Just know I'm a fan of charthur, johnibgal, and vandermatthews. Literally thats it. Only ones I can tolerate, sorry. Jovier and sadigal takes 20 years of my life everytime i see it.

Sexual comments bother us if you're not a close friend, please avoid them. We don't like the "im gonna touch you" jokes either.


We walk away or go silent if you make us uncomfortable usually, or we just say "oh" or "uh". We make it obvious. </p>
