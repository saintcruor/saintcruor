<a href="https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/" title="Link to carrd listing basic dni criteria">the basics</a>, xenosatanist, radqueer, proship (including alts: darkship, comship. peacefic is ok), anti-endogenic and <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Willogenic" title="definition">willogenic</a> systems, pro-contact / complex contact paraphilia, zionists/stand with israel, over 19 (18 is thin ice), anti-furries, anti-therians, against selfshipping. And also against paraphiles (that at most seek help, or are anti-contact.)

psuedocest shippers like athur x john i fucking HATE you, along with dutch x john or arthur. side eye. i also hate bill williamson sorry.

if you make sensual jokes or carnal comments we'll stop talking to you, you're weird. we dont like you.

<p align="right"> <b> <em> " BEFORE YOU INTERACT WITH US !!! " </em> </b> </p> 

<p align="right"> We are a plurallet praesigenic <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Parasian" title="definition">parasian</a> system, we switch in-between "i/me" and "we/us". Do NOT use they/them if referring to us collectively, ask prns and names instead. We do not mind if you ask who is fronting. We exclusively give our simplyplural to people we trust, but we keep our pluralkit public nonetheless but neither are updated frequently, rather a headcount and information archival.

We are very, <em> very </em> shy. We usually won't interact first unless we're feeling brave enough to crown someone or say hi. if we share an interest and we interact, we're most likely asking to be friends/mutuals.

Host and co-host are selfshippers; do not say mary-beth, kieran, javier, or dutch is your favorite, ship them with someone else, or say they're your spouse. Host (desmond) is with kieran, mary-beth, javier, and co-host (micah) is selfship by proxy with dutch van der linde. Quiet would like to note she is yumeship with venom snake by proxy as well.

We walk away or go silent if you make us uncomfortable usually, or we just say "oh" or "uh". We make it obvious. </p>
